# SharePoint-helpers

This repo contains a number of different helpful javascript bookmarklets for SharePoint developers, admins, users etc provided under the MIT license.

## SharePoint 2010

* SPNavigate.js - Open a command prompt to navigate to any list/library in the current web (with autocomplete).
* showWebPropertyBag.js - Show the property bag for the current spweb


## SharePoint 2007/2010 Location Bookmarklets

These all take you somewhere useful on the current site. I just have a bookmark folder that contains each of these bookmarklets. These should work in both SharePoint 2007 and SharePoint 2010. I'll probably add these to SPNavigate.js at some point soon.
