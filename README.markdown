# SharePoint-bookmarklets

This repo contains a number of different helpful javascript bookmarklets for SharePoint developers, admins, users etc provided under the MIT license.


## SharePoint 2010

* SPNavigate.js - Open a command prompt to quickly navigate to any list/library in the current web (with autocomplete). Now also includes common layouts pages, these all start with @.
* showWebPropertyBag.js - Show the property bag for the current spweb
* changeItemCreatedDate.js - Easily change the Created date of the current item (use this while looking at the modal dialog for the item's ViewForm). Only works for modal dialog forms right now, I'll add support for non-modal viewforms soon.
